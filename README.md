# BlackJack
A simple blackjack game with python some rules:
Cards cannot repeat, i.e. a card drawn cannot be drawn again from the pack in the same round.
If you or the computer exceeds 21, you/it go(es) bust and lose(s) the round automatically.
If Aces are included in your hand, the program must be able to decide whether to use it as 11 or as 1. If the total exceeds 21 when Ace is used as 11, then its value must be changed to 1.
